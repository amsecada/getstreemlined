# Meet (BA)bs, the Business Analyst Bot
Babs came about as a need for a client. This particular one had a need for a Retrieval Augmented Generative (RAG) Application with the
ability to learn at regular intervals as content came in, iterate on this content, expound upon it, and mash it up in various ways to simulate innovation.
Over time, the Application would learn the tastes of Management and get more sophisticated with its recommendations.

## (BA)bs is currently in Pilot for a Small Group of testers, Please Get in Contact if you would like to be added to the waitlist.
