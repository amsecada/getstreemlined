# About Us
### **Streemline is where AI meets integrity—your trusted partner in creating fair, efficient, and effective AI strategies without the fluff.**

## Introduction:
In the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence, finding a partner you can trust is crucial. At Streemline, we aren’t just another consulting firm—we’re a movement against the status quo. Our story began with a deep-seated frustration toward the prevalent, often predatory practices in the consulting industry. Our founder, with 20 years of experience working with the world’s largest and most profitable companies, saw firsthand how clients were misled, overcharged, and underdelivered. This frustration led to the birth of Streemline, a firm committed to doing things differently.

## Our Journey:
For decades, our founder witnessed consulting firms promising the moon and delivering mediocrity. From inflated budgets to unnecessary custom builds, from dragging out projects to increase billable hours, to outsourcing work overseas despite promises of local development—these were the industry norms we couldn’t stand by.

When the wave of Artificial Intelligence began transforming industries, our founder saw an opportunity. He walked away from a lucrative career to create Streemline—a consulting firm that would embody the values of transparency, fairness, and excellence. No hidden agendas, no exclusive partnerships—just honest, expert advice tailored to your needs.

## What Makes Us Different?

- **Efficiency:** We value your time as much as you do. Our team is dedicated to delivering results on time and within budget.
- **Integrity:** Our recommendations are based solely on what’s best for your business. We have no exclusive partnerships that influence our advice.
- **Expertise:** With decades of experience in technology consulting, we bring deep knowledge and a pragmatic approach to AI implementation.
